    <p1>As an international sneak thief, you break into vaults all the time. Riddling out a simple 3 digit code is child’s play for you. But you must be getting sloppy in your old age because you’ve tripped an alarm. In no time at all, the police will be all over the place. Can you get Chris's solid gold badminton racket from his vault before getting caught?</p1>
    
    <p1>You will have to crack a 3 digit random code in 7 turns. Each time the you complete a 3 digit guess, the poorly designed safe will tell you whether the code is higher, lower, or correct.</p>
    
    <p1>You know the 3 digit code will be only using the digits 1 through 3 because the owner never quite learned how to count past 3.</p1>
    
    <p1>Goodluck!</p1>
